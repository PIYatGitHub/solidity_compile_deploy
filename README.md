# Solidity contracts builder
This project will provide a tool to build, test and deploy a contract (in the sample case inbox.sol) to a test network. 

# Project structure
We have a simple node project with a few folders and files as follows: 

1. `/contracts` - holds all the contracts we have (in this case `inbox.sol`)
2. `/test` - holds the full on test suite for all of our contracts. 
3. `deploy.js` - a way to deploy the code we just wrote. 
4. `compile.js` - a way to compile the code we just wrote.
